if (you are fixing a bug on the master branch that is a quick fix OR the changes you are implementing are minor)
{
	send an email to the programming team as a whole announcing the file you will be changing when you start;
	send another email when you have finished letting the team know to pull the new master;
}
else //if the changes are a new featureset or will take more than a few hours
{
	create a new branch for your task; //try to name it appropriately
	sync with the master frequently to keep your code up to date and prevent merge conflicts;
	merge when you are done; //send an email to anyone waiting on your code to be done
	if (there is a merge conflict)
	{
		try
		{
			resolve the merge conflict;
		}
		catch (you cannot figure it out)
		{
			send me an email at msf12@hampshire.edu or a text and we can figure it out;
		}
	}
	delete the branch after merging;
}
